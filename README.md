- ðŸ˜„ sporting feats always manage to capture my attention, but above all those that seem impossible for a team that reaches a record being one that did not have the best resources, that is why although I am not a fan of Bayer Leverkusen I have closely followed its development in the bundesliga 2023-2024, which they manage to win with an undefeated record, dethroning the unbeatable Bayern Munich.
The most notable thing is that they did not spend amounts of money like they do in other clubs in other leagues to get a title, this is related to one of my favorite movies "Money Ball" where the manager of Oakland Athletics baseball team that has limitations Budget teams to compete hire players for their skills after analyzing their statistics in a different way than was traditionally done.
That's why these inspiring stories are my favorites, they show that analysis and decision making depend on many more factors than just money.
